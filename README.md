#A folder with a bunch of random scripts that I have written


# nposulinux
the simplest (and worst) now playing program for osu on linux and also windows if this worked on windows (it doesn't)

how to: add temp.txt as a text source to obs, check the checkboxes 'read from file' and 'chat log mode' and set the value of 'chat log lines' to 1

run nposulinux.py with
[python3 nposulinux.py]
and click on the osu process

when you tab back into obs you will notice that I am in fact a jackass, and can't figure out how to get it to trim properly, so you're going to need to do that yourself with obs's crop function. lol, lmao.

# osu!dvr 
automatically spectates and records a given player in osu, so that you can leave osu open overnight, and still watch someone who happens to play in another timezone. Instructions on how to use are given on runtime.
linux only, I think, you can still try it if you want to

# dwm_time_and_battery
very apt name, I made this while I was bored in chem class lol. this is a really simple script you can add to your autostart which will set the text that usually says dwm-5.0 or whatever to the current date time and battery percentage once a second very cool I think enjoy
