# nposulinux
the simplest (and worst) now playing program for osu on linux and also windows if this worked on windows (it doesn't)

how to: add temp.txt as a text source to obs, check the checkboxes 'read from file' and 'chat log mode' and set the value of 'chat log lines' to 1

run nposulinux.py with
[python3 nposulinux.py]
and click on the osu process

when you tab back into obs you will notice that I am in fact a jackass, and can't figure out how to get it to trim properly, so you're going to need to do that yourself with obs's crop function. sorry about that, I did it on purpose.
